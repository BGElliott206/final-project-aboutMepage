            <div class="text">After spending my life in kitchens, I decided to make a change in my life. Iâ€™ve always been very interested in learning to code, and after a life time decided to make that change. I figured with my eye for details, organization and work ethic learned in kitchens I would have a fun time learning a new language(s).

              <div class="text">After serving 6 years in the military as Persian Farsi linguist and Intelligence analyst, I decided to apply those language learning and logic skills to a career in coding. At the beginning of April I dropped everything and moved across the country to puruse that goal. I hope you enjoy our first independent project after completing Code Fellows 201.     </div>
